Don't wait until you're "ready" to speak. **Mistakes are essential** for learning. Native speakers appreciate the effort, even if your grammar isn't perfect.

- **Listening practice** (podcasts, videos, movies)
- **Reading** (articles, books, subtitles)

French has different sentence structures. Learn **phrases** and **expressions** as chunks, not word-by-word translations.

### Mistake #5: Comparing Yourself to Others

Everyone learns at their own pace. Focus on **your progress**, not others'. Celebrate small wins!
